        "As the first founder of Pleiades Mental Health, I was able to develop a state-of-the-art mental health platform. Following the precedent of preventive care, our goal is to onboard clients when they first start experiencing symptoms related to any form of mental health, and while we treat and support the current issues impacting them, we also teach them coping techniques and skills while providing them with a full platform of self-support and community tools to help them in the future. For our therapists, we want to help them get back to what they signed up for, which is helping people. By using our platform, we are able to save them time running their practices, simplify their operations, and show them tangible data to justify the progress their clients are making to help reduce burnout. Click below to learn about all of the platform offerings I built, including a comprehensive analytics dashboard leveraging machine learning for predictive insights and real-time data visualization.",

        "As the former CEO and Founder, and a high school sophomore, we set out to build a new app that changes the way people seek mental health treatment. This led us on a journey of creating a free app that uses open-source, publicly available content and in-house generated content to build a free resource platform that helped teens develop coping mechanisms. While I have since moved on to creating a platform with more offerings in Pleiades, in IvySky's heyday as a fully registered 501(c)3, we were still able to help teens in need with a team of 55 therapists, coders, marketers, and doctors. We achieved a high of $60,000 in funding and 500 daily active users. We are currently working on a new platform. Click below to learn more about IvySky.",

      "A fully automated and interactive garden that, using a wide variety of code and sensors, was able to grow 35 plants and 15 flowers with automated lighting, watering, and feeding. This project was built for a class on the Arduino platform using pumps, relays, breadboards, and 20 water sensors for independent readings of each bed. To build this system, I purchased and correctly cut wood boards, cut ten 12-inch PVC pipes to exact specifications, and 3D-printed 24 joints that I designed and scaled in Onshape. The entire garden, including the wiring, was designed and built in Onshape.",
