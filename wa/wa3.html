      <h3>Film Synopsis</h3>
      <p>
        In Earth's future, a global crop blight and second Dust Bowl are slowly
        rendering the planet uninhabitable. Professor Brand (Michael Caine), a
        brilliant NASA physicist, is working on plans to save mankind by
        transporting Earth's population to a new home via a wormhole. But first,
        Brand must send former NASA pilot Cooper (Matthew McConaughey) and a
        team of researchers through the wormhole and across the galaxy to find
        out which of three planets could be mankind's new home.

      <h3>Imporant Plots</h3>
      <p>
        In the near future, humanity is facing extinction following a global
        famine caused by ecocide.[8] Cooper's family, which includes his
        children, Tom and Murph, and his father-in-law Donald, survive by
        pursuing farming, much like most of humanity. One evening after a dust
        storm, Cooper discovers a gravitational anomaly inside Murph's bedroom,
        which creates patterns of falling particles. The pattern resolves into
        GPS coordinates, which leads Cooper and Murph to a secret NASA facility.
        NASA is believed to have shut down but continues to operate, its latest
        mission being to find a habitable planet beyond the solar system. A team
        is preparing to travel through a wormhole near Saturn, leading to a
        faraway galaxy that has three potentially habitable planets, each
        orbiting the supermassive blackhole called Gargantua. Cooper is asked by
        Dr. Brand, the lead scientist, to pilot the crew due to past experience.
        Cooper struggles to leave behind Murph, but agrees after promising her
        that he will return. Heartbroken, Murph acts cold towards Cooper, and
        refuses to say goodbye. The Endurance spacecraft takes off with three
        other NASA scientists − Romilly, Doyle and Brand's daughter Amelia − as
        well as two intelligent robots, TARS and CASE. Past the wormhole, the
        crew arrive at the first planet, an ocean world with massive tidal
        waves. Doyle is swept away within minutes, but Cooper and Amelia survive
        a round of waves to return to the Endurance. Though they were only gone
        a few hours, they find that 23 years have passed due to time dilation.
        Back on Earth, an adult Murph, who is still mad at Cooper, is helping
        Dr. Brand formulate an equation to solve the problem of mass exodus —
        transporting Earth's population off the planet while escaping its
        gravity. On his deathbed, Brand reveals that the equation is unsolvable.
        Murph is left alone to continue his work and turns to her childhood
        bedroom as the source of the initial anomaly, to look for clues. She
        comes across the wrist-watch Cooper gave her before he left on her
        bookshelf. On the second planet, the crew find the planet's previous
        NASA explorer, Dr. Mann, still alive and in cryostasis. They awaken him,
        and learn that the planet has positive data linked to habitability. On a
        scouting mission, however, Mann confesses to having lied so that someone
        might come and rescue him from the ice-world planet. He sets off a chain
        of events that results in Romilly's death. He takes the Endurance crew's
        lander and attempts to seize control of the Endurance. However, TARS
        removed his security clearance to successfully do so, but Mann persists.
        This attempt leads to his death and a portion of Endurance exploding.
        Cooper and Amelia regain control of the craft, but, with limited
        resources, must chart a gravity-assist path around Gargantua to propel
        the craft to the third planet. At the last moment, Cooper detaches
        himself and TARS so that Amelia may reach the final planet safely. He
        and TARS fall beyond the black hole's event horizon. Inside, Cooper and
        TARS find a mysterious five-dimensional tesseract where time is a
        physical dimension. Cooper is able to use gravity to communicate with
        his past self, and realizes he sent himself the NASA coordinates,
        initiating this mission. He realizes that the goal is to feed Murph the
        blackhole gravity-data to help her solve the equation, and encodes the
        data into the ticking pattern of his wristwatch. Murph finds the watch
        on her visit there and uses it to solve Brand's equation. The tesseract
        dissolves, ejecting Cooper and TARS through the wormhole and into
        Saturn's orbit again, where a present-day (22nd century CE) space-faring
        O'Neill cylinder picks them up. Cooper awakens inside a hospital and is
        reunited with an aging Murph, who is now considerably older than him.
        Murph asks that Cooper leave her and instead find Amelia. Cooper and
        TARS set off for the third planet, where Amelia is directing the setup
        of a new colony in the planet's desert-like environment. Alone on the
        habitable planet, she takes off her helmet and breathes in the air.

    <section>
        <h3>Christopher Nolan Director </h3>
      <p>
        Christopher Edward Nolan CBE (born 30 July 1970) is a British-American filmmaker. Known for his Hollywood blockbusters with complex storytelling, Nolan is considered a leading filmmaker of the 21st century. He has received many accolades, including nominations for eight Academy Awards, and his films have grossed more than $6 billion worldwide, ranking him among the highest-grossing directors. In 2015, he was listed as one of the 100 most influential people in the world by Time, and in 2024, he was honoured with a British Film Institute Fellowship.

Nolan developed an interest in filmmaking from a young age. After studying English literature at University College London, he made several short films before his feature film debut with Following (1998). Nolan gained international recognition with his second film, Memento (2000), for which he was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay. He transitioned from independent to studio filmmaking with Insomnia (2002), and found further critical and commercial success with The Dark Knight trilogy (2005–2012), The Prestige (2006) and Inception (2010); the last of these earned Nolan two Oscar nominations—Best Picture and Best Original Screenplay. This was followed by Interstellar (2014), Dunkirk (2017) and Tenet (2020). For the war drama Dunkirk, he earned two Academy Award nominations, including his first for Best Director. Parting ways with longtime distributor Warner Bros. Pictures, Nolan signed with Universal Pictures for the biopic Oppenheimer (2023), which won him the Golden Globe Award for Best Director.

Nolan's work regularly features in the listings of best films of their respective decades. Infused with a metaphysical outlook, his films thematise epistemology, existentialism, ethics, the construction of time, and the malleable nature of memory and personal identity. They feature mathematically-inspired images and concepts, unconventional narrative structures, practical special effects, experimental soundscapes, large-format film photography, and materialistic perspectives. He has co-written several of his films with his brother, Jonathan, and runs the production company Syncopy Inc. with his wife, Emma Thomas.

    <section>
    <h3>Scientfic Accuracy</h3>
      <p>
        Regarding the concepts of wormholes and black holes, Kip Thorne said he "worked on the equations that would enable tracing of light rays as they traveled through a wormhole or around a black 
        hole—so what you see is based on Einstein's general relativity equations".Early in the process, Thorne laid down two guidelines: 
        "First, that nothing would violate established physical laws. Second, that all the wild speculations ... would spring from science and not from the fertile mind of a screenwriter." 
        Nolan accepted these terms as long as they did not get in the way of making the film.At one point, 
        Thorne spent two weeks arguing Nolan out of having a character traveling faster than light before Nolan finally gave up. 
        According to Thorne, the element that has the highest degree of artistic freedom is the clouds of ice on one of the planets they visit, 
        which are structures that would go beyond the material strength that ice could support.The astrobiologist David Grinspoon criticized the dire "blight" situation on 
        Earth portrayed in the early scenes, pointing out that even with a voracious blight it would have taken millions of years to reduce the atmosphere's oxygen content. He also notes that gravity should 
        have pulled down the ice clouds. Neil deGrasse Tyson, an astrophysicist, explored the science behind the ending of Interstellar, concluding that it is theoretically
        possible to interact with the past, and that "we don't really know what's in a black hole, so take it and run with it".[62] The theoretical physicist Michio Kaku praised
        the film for its scientific accuracy and said Interstellar "could set the gold standard for science fiction movies for years to come". Timothy Reyes, a former NASA software engineer, 
        said "Thorne's and Nolan's accounting of black holes and wormholes and the use of gravity is excellent".

      <h3>WormHoles And Black Holes</h3>
      <p>
        To create the visual effects for the wormhole and a rotating, supermassive black hole (possessing an ergosphere, as opposed to a non-rotating black hole), Thorne collaborated with Franklin and a team of 30 people at Double Negative, providing pages of deeply sourced theoretical equations to the engineers, who then wrote new CGI rendering software based on these equations to create accurate simulations of the gravitational lensing caused by these phenomena. Some individual frames took up to 100 hours to render, totaling 800 terabytes of data.[10] Thorne described the accretion disk of the black hole as "anemic and at low temperature[64]—about the temperature of the surface of the sun," allowing it to emit appreciable light, but not enough gamma radiation and X-rays to threaten nearby astronauts and planets.[65] The resulting visual effects provided Thorne with new insight into the gravitational lensing and accretion disks surrounding black holes, resulting in the publication of three scientific papers.[66][67][68]
    

The first image of the event horizon of a black hole, obtained by the Event Horizon Telescope. The asymmetric brightness of the accretion disk is well visible here.
Nolan was initially concerned that a scientifically accurate depiction of a black hole would not be visually comprehensible to an audience, and would require the effects team to unrealistically alter its appearance. The visual representation of the black hole in the film does not account for the Doppler effect which, when added by the visual effects team, resulted in an asymmetrically lit black and blue-black hole, the purpose of which Nolan thought the audience would not understand. As a result, it was omitted in the finished product.[69] Nolan found the finished effect to be understandable, as long as he maintained consistent camera perspectives.[70]

As a reference, the asymmetric brightness of the accretion disk is very well visible in the first image[71] of the event horizon of a black hole obtained by the Event Horizon Telescope team in 2019. Futura-Sciences praised the correct depiction of the Penrose process.[72]

According to Space.com, the portrayal of what a wormhole would look like is scientifically correct. Rather than a two-dimensional hole in space, it is depicted as a sphere, showing a distorted view of the target galaxy

        <h3> Theatrical Release Notes</h3>
      <p>
        Before Interstellar's public release, Paramount CEO Brad Grey hosted a private screening on October 19, 2014, at an IMAX theater in Lincoln Square, Manhattan.[88][89] Paramount then showed Interstellar to some of the industry's filmmakers and actors in a first-look screening at the California Science Center on October 22.[90] On the following day, the film was screened at the TCL Chinese Theatre in Los Angeles, California for over 900 members of the Screen Actors Guild.[91] The film premiered on October 26 at the TCL Chinese Theatre in Los Angeles,[92] and in Europe on October 29 at the Odeon Leicester Square in London. The film premiered on November 7 in Canada.[93][94]

Interstellar was released early on November 4 in various 70 mm IMAX film, 70 mm film and 35 mm film theaters, and had a limited release in North America on November 5, with a wide release on November 7.[95] The film was released in Belgium, France, and Switzerland on November 5, the UK on November 7 and in additional territories in the following days.[96] For the limited North American release, Interstellar was projected from 70 mm and 35 mm film in 249 theaters that still supported those formats, including at least forty-one 70 mm IMAX theaters. A 70 mm IMAX projector was installed at the TCL Chinese Theatre in Los Angeles to display the format. The film's wide release expanded to theaters that showed it digitally.[97] Paramount Pictures distributed the film in North America, and Warner Bros. distributed it in the remaining territories.[32] The film was released in over 770 IMAX screens worldwide, which was the largest global release in IMAX cinemas,[98][99] until surpassed by Universal Pictures' Furious 7 (2015) with 810 IMAX theaters.[100]

Interstellar was an exception to Paramount Pictures' goal to stop releasing films on film stock and to distribute them only in digital format.[101] According to Pamela McClintock of The Hollywood Reporter, the initiative to project Interstellar on film stock would help preserve an endangered format,[97] which was supported by Christopher Nolan, J. J. Abrams, Quentin Tarantino, Judd Apatow, Paul Thomas Anderson, and other filmmakers.[102] McClintock reported that theatre owners saw this as "backward," as nearly all theatres in the US had been converted to digital projection.[103]
      </p>
      <h3> Home Release Notes</h3>
      <p>
        Interstellar was released on home video on March 31, 2015, in both the United Kingdom and United States.[104] It topped the home video sales chart for a total of two weeks.[105][106] It was reported that Interstellar was the most pirated film of 2015, with an estimated 46.7 million downloads on BitTorrent.[107] It was released in the Ultra HD Blu-ray format on December 19, 2017.[108]
